## Rules

The goal is to score as many points as possible by shooting the enemies, like forthcoming asteroids. Beware of using up all of your bullets, because there can be **maximum nine bullets** on the screen at once!

The game ends if the spaceship collides with an enemy, or the enemy reaches the area behind the spaceship.

**Enemy types:**
 - Asteroid:

## Controls

The main principle during the development is to make the game cross-platform compilable between Android and Windows/MacOS. For this reason the spacheship isn't controlled by any of the keyboard button, but the mouse gestures and clicks that can be interpreted as swipes and taps on a touchscreen.

**On Windows/MacOS**
Move the mouse up and down to adjust the position of the spaceship. By clicking, you can shoot the bullet.

**On Android**
Swipe up or down on the touchscreen to adjust the position of the spaceship. Tap the display to shoot a bullet.
